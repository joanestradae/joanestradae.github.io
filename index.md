        <h1>Hi there TSH m8s. We're trying to build a website.</h1>
        <p>We want to make a website. We’ll start simple so we get knowledge mostly from HTML and CSS,  
        get a better understanding on what it is and how it affects a website. </p>
        <p>Once we start with the basics and get used to html and css we could start making some more advanced stuff (maybe JS)</p>
        <p>For now, we can start using the next resources</p>
        <h1>Visual Studio code</h1>
        <p>You can use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual studio</a> to make your website</p>

        <h1>LEARNING HTML FROM BEGGINNER</h1>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UB1O30fR-EE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h1>LEARNING CSS FROM BEGINNER (BETTER KNOW HTML BEFORE GOING INTO THIS ONE)</h1>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yfoY53QXEnI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h1>LEARNING JAVASCRIPT (JS) FROM BEGINNER (MAYBE WE WON'T GET THAT MUCH INTO THIS ONE)</h1>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hdI2bqOjy3c" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h1>W3 schools is awesome</h1>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">
            W3 Schools is an excelent tool</a> It has HTML and CSS tutorias with pretty easy to use playground where you can easily check 
            how an attribute works for html, css or javascript with their useful try it yourself button
        </p>
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_buttons_basic" class="button" target="_blank">Try it yourself »</a>
        <p>keep in mind that i'm learning too so this may not be a good example of good practices when it comes to web development, but you can check the html code for this as a base for yours</p>
        <a class="secreto">it's an awful example actually</a>
        <p>the idea here is to get a better grasp on basic concepts needed for support.</p>
        <p>We should try to make it simple but still can have some interactive elements. The internet is full of examples of buttons and slideshows. Try to use HTML and CSS only. Of course you can copy paste the code to make those elements, but at least try to understand what each of the lines there do and play around with it, maybe change it a little.
